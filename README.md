Task Manager Web Application
A modern and interactive Task Manager web application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add, categorize, and track tasks through three main categories: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

Features
Task Creation: Add tasks with a title, description, deadline, and priority level.
Task Categorization: Tasks are organized into different categories like To Do, In Progress, and Done.
Drag and Drop: Easily move tasks between categories to track progress.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Dark Mode Theme: Elegant dark theme for improved user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the app.
CSS: Styling the UI with a clean, minimalistic design.
JavaScript: Managing task data and local storage functionality.

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone 
Navigate into the project directory:

How It Works
Add Tasks: Users can input a task title, description, deadline, and priority, then click Add Task to create a new task.
Categorize Tasks: New tasks appear in the To Do category by default. As you work on them, you can drag and drop tasks into In Progress or Done.
Task Details: Each task card shows important details like title, description, deadline, and priority.
